# Zebra Design - Designers That Code with AI

Zebra Design helps founders and teams launch digital products—designed and coded—faster than thought possible. This is the official website showcasing our Design-as-a-Service model.

## Credits

This project is based on the [Lume Studio Next.js Template](https://github.com/haramishra/lume-studio-next) by [Hara Mishra](https://github.com/haramishra). The original template provided an excellent foundation with smooth animations and modern UI components that we've customized and expanded for our needs.

2.  **Run the development server:**

    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3.  **Build for production:**
