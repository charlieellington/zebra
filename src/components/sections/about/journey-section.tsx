Just sunrise surf sessions and the freedom to do absolutely nothing productive. It was exactly what I needed to reset and remember why I create in the first place.",

No more handoffs to developers, no more lost-in-translation moments. Now I design in Figma AND build in code, seeing my ideas come to life completely. It's addictive. I'm having more fun than ever because I'm finally doing what I love most: creating products from start to finish.",
