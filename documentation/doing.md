Create the pricing page build plan. The content for it is below and needs the following: 

- Better examples for calculating the value - total of three - clearly communicated 
- Clear links to the Agile Money For Nothing Principle and well explained. 
- Restructured to explain all this is the best possible way. 
- Implement best practices for UX, layout, and content flow based on current standards for agency sites
- Clean up grammar and tighten phrasing using a minimalist, Hemingway-style approach
- Retain my personal tone and solo practice voice

Additional we're missing a key concept of my pricing model: 

- There is the base price for design and code service
- Then there are additional usage charges as follows: 
- Workshops ‚Ç¨400 per day, includes prep and workshop facilitation 
- Month 1 workshops are included up to five days 
- Additional meetings, e.g. zoom calls, ‚Ç¨150/hr when request by the client. (I may use them to speed up processes and then they're on me) 
- Additional user testing rounds after month one: ‚Ç¨1,000 - with five or six users per round, includes, prep, 1:1 remote testing, reporting and workshop on the results. 
- I've explained this before on this site - https://decommerce-proposal.vercel.app/ - you can borrow concepts from there about this being AI first, incentivising time to get the best results, etc. 

- IMPORTANT: Make sure all content is in the build plan so we don't loose anything. 


COPY FIRST DRAFT THAT NEEDS EDITING AND THEN GOING INTO THE BUILD PLAN: 

**Pricing page**

We offer a straightforward **monthly subscription** for our design+development service. It‚Äôs a flat fee that gives you a dedicated, on-call product team. **Plans start at approximately ‚Ç¨5,000 per month** for a standard engagement, which includes unlimited design/development requests (one task at a time, handled with high quality focus. If you need to accelerate more, you can scale up with additional parallel workstreams (similar to adding another ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù for a second simultaneous task). 

**No long-term contract** ‚Äì it‚Äôs strictly month-to-month, **cancel any time**. Think of it like an agile sprint: you pay for a month, we deliver as much value as possible in that time. You can renew, pause, or stop based on your needs. We‚Äôll even help estimate how many months or cycles you might need to reach your goals, so you have a clear roadmap from the start. And of course, if priorities change, you‚Äôre never locked in ‚Äì our model is as flexible as your startup needs to be.

**Calculating the monthly fee**

**‚ÄúHire us to get the job done, risk-free:** We structure our pricing around the _value and outcomes_ we deliver to your business. Instead of paying for endless hours or features you don‚Äôt need, you invest a fixed monthly amount aligned with the results you‚Äôre after. If we estimate our work will add roughly ‚Ç¨500k to your bottom line in two years, your cost would be about 20% of that over one year of our work or: ‚Ç¨8k per month for one year ‚Äì a **small fraction** of that value.

Example 1: 
Value Calculation: 
We save on your team costs by creating an application for onboarding your customers: it frees up 10% of your team times and increases revenue by 20% - ‚Ç¨300k value over two years. 
Our Fee: 
‚Ç¨300k x 20% = ‚Ç¨60k 
over 12 months = ‚Ç¨5k our fee per month 

Example 2: 
We take a workflow out of your development teams hands (one PM, one designer and two developers) costing ‚Ç¨420k over a year 
Our Fee: 
‚Ç¨400k x 20% = ‚Ç¨84k 
over 12 months = ‚Ç¨7k our fee per month 

****

And here‚Äôs the best part: **you‚Äôre free to cancel anytime**. Once you‚Äôve gotten what you need (your new product features are live and bringing in revenue, or your team is ready to take over), you can stop the engagement. 

You‚Äôll only pay a small wrap-up fee (20% of the remaining year), and you keep all the benefits delivered so far. This means we‚Äôre motivated to deliver meaningful results from month one, and you never pay for work that isn‚Äôt moving you closer to your goals. It‚Äôs a win-win: you get value early and often, and you have the flexibility to scale down when you‚Äôre satisfied.‚Äù*

We offer a flexible monthly subscription model with three plan tiers to fit your needs:

- **UI/UX Design Only** ‚Äì We design your product‚Äôs interface _in code_ and deliver a polished front-end using modern UI libraries. Perfect if you only need UX/UI design and a clickable front-end prototype.
    
- **Front-End Development** ‚Äì Custom design **plus** a front-end application built in Cursor, our AI-assisted development environment. We‚Äôll create your UX/UI and code a front-end app (documented in Storybook or using the shadcn component library) ready to plug into your backend.
    
- **Full-Stack Development** ‚Äì A complete end-to-end product. We design the UI and build the entire application in Cursor, including front-end and back-end development, delivering a fully functional app.

See the initial build plan and the sub-plans we've made attached, is there anything else we need to do as a final step. Include this as a build plan step in itself so we have clear instructions to finalise and launch the website.
