## Who I Help 

- **Startup founders** ‚Äì who need to test a new app idea _ASAP_ to find product‚Äìmarket fit before the runway runs out. (We provide the speed and lean iteration to do exactly that.)
    
- **Product teams with developers** ‚Äì who have engineering talent but lack UX/UI bandwidth. We‚Äôll slot in as your design & front-end experts, rapidly shaping your product‚Äôs interface and even integrating with your backend.
    
- **SMEs and non-tech businesses** ‚Äì that need a custom internal tool or app built from scratch (and don‚Äôt have an in-house design or dev team). We design and build your solution end-to-end, fast.
    
- **Teams with an MVP** ‚Äì who have a bare-bones product that users find clunky or limited. We can overhaul your UX/UI and quickly add the features users are asking for to level up your product.
    
- **Companies stuck in limbo** ‚Äì after freelancers or agencies have let you down with delays, miscommunication, or lack of accountability. Our integrated approach gets your product moving forward again with weekly visible progress.

## Pricing 

**Headline:** *Value‚Äëbased, month‚Äëto‚Äëmonth. Starts ~‚Ç¨5‚ÄØk.*\
*Sub‚Äëcopy:* "You pay ~20‚ÄØ% of the value I create over two years. Cancel anytime---only a 20‚ÄØ% wrap‚Äëup fee on the remaining balance (based on the Agile 'Money‚ÄØfor‚ÄØNothing' Principle)." 

[Pricing Calculations]

**Example Services**: 

| Tier                  | Short pitch                                                                          | Typical fit                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **UI/UX‚ÄØDesign¬†Only** | Design in code. Pixel‚Äëperfect front‚Äëend using a UI library.                          | Teams with back‚Äëend devs in place. |
| **Front‚ÄëEnd**         | Custom design‚ÄØ+ coded front‚Äëend app (e.g. custom in Storybook or shadcn UI library). | SaaS founders who need UI + build. |
| **Full‚ÄëStack**        | Complete app (front‚Äë & back‚Äëend) built in Cursor.                                    | Zero‚Äëto‚Äëone product build.         |
**Pricing & Terms:** Plans start at approximately **‚Ç¨5k per month**. We typically price at about **20% of the projected value** we‚Äôll deliver to your business over 2 years. (For example, if our solution is estimated to save you around ‚Ç¨500k in two years, the subscription would be roughly ‚Ç¨8k per month.) All plans are **no long-term lock-in** ‚Äì you can cancel at any time. If you do choose to end the engagement early, we only charge a modest **20% wrap-up fee** on the remaining contract value of the first year (following the agile ‚ÄúMoney for Nothing‚Äù principle, to fairly cover the unused work). In short: we succeed when you succeed, and we‚Äôre confident in delivering value far above our cost.

How we overcome your typical product issues without hiring in house: 

-  **"**12‚Äëmonth nightmare dev timelines ":** 
- **Designers that code with AI** ‚ñ∏\  I avoid this entirely. Using AI and Cursor, I build user-centric MVPs in weeks, not months. I've spent all of 2025 using these new tools and iterating on processes to be confident to offer my design first AI coding skills as a service. 

-   **"**Design vs dev mismatch":** 
  - **I have over a decade of experience launching early-stage products** ‚ñ∏\ (as a freelancer and as founder of Deep Work) means I know how to tightly integrate design with development. Ramp Network raised $120¬†million on a product I designed, Ethereum launched its Eth 2.0 staking through an interface I crafted, and Nexus Mutual---now a leader in web3 insurance---runs on a platform I design before web3 experiences were a thing. These are all examples of seamless design-to-development execution.

-   **"Freelancers without priorities":** 
- **I understand your needs as a startup founder** ‚ñ∏\ I've been a startup founder myself, launching three different companies. I understand your needs and what actually matters when bringing a product to market---speed and continuous user feedback. You'll never have to worry about misaligned priorities or a freelancer dragging out chargeable days. 

-   **"Burning cash without users or validation":** 
- **Process based on Google Venture's Design Sprints and seven years of working with early stage tech teams.** ‚ñ∏\ At Deep Work Studio (my last design agency), we perfected an early prototype testing model. This scientific, rapid design process delivers validated designs in weeks instead of months, so you won't waste time or money on unproven ideas.

## FAQs

**How can you deliver so fast?**  
We‚Äôve honed an ultra-streamlined process. From day one we leverage your team‚Äôs existing knowledge (instead of weeks of slow ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù), then we use efficient tools like AI coding assistants and pre-built components. By focusing only on what matters for the user and building in code immediately (no throwaway mockups), we compress the timeline dramatically without cutting corners. The result is high-quality output at breakneck speed.

**What does ‚Äúunlimited requests‚Äù really mean?**  
Exactly what it sounds like ‚Äì you can request as many features, design tweaks, or tasks as you want each month. We‚Äôll handle them one at a time with laser focus to maintain quality. You can continually prioritise your backlog, and we‚Äôll keep delivering tasks in order of importance. There‚Äôs effectively no cap on the amount of work; we just make sure each item is done right before moving to the next.

**Can you work with our existing team?**  
Absolutely. Think of us as an extension of your team ‚Äì a special forces unit that plugs right in. If you have in-house developers, we‚Äôll collaborate with them (for example, we can consume your existing API or work alongside your back-end engineers). If you have a product manager or designer, we‚Äôll sync up to ensure our work complements yours. We play nice with any stack or team; our goal is to enhance your capabilities, not duplicate or disrupt them.

**What if I just need design or just development?**  
That‚Äôs fine too! We‚Äôre flexible. If you only need design, we offer a **design-in-code** plan where we craft your UX/UI in live code and deliver an interactive front-end for your developers to plug into. Conversely, if you already have designs and just need them built out, we can go into **dev-only mode** ‚Äì turning your existing design files into a working product. Our subscription adapts to what you need: you‚Äôre hiring us to achieve outcomes (finished designs, coded features), not to fill a timesheet.

**Is there a commitment?**  
No long-term commitment required. Our standard engagement is month-to-month ‚Äî use us for as long (or as short) as you need. You can cancel anytime. If you‚Äôre on a multi-month plan or decide to stop mid-project, you‚Äôre free to do so; we‚Äôd just charge a 20% wrap-up fee on the remaining work as a courtesy (this follows agile‚Äôs ‚Äúcancel anytime‚Äù ethos with a fair compensation for unused time). Many clients start with a one-month pilot to see the value first-hand. If you love the results, you can simply continue; if not, you can stop with no hard feelings.

PROMPT 6 

Create the pricing page build plan. The content for it is below and needs the following: 

- Better examples for calculating the value - total of three - clearly communicated 
- Clear links to the Agile Money For Nothing Principle and well explained. 
- Restructured to explain all this is the best possible way. 
- Implement best practices for UX, layout, and content flow based on current standards for agency sites
- Clean up grammar and tighten phrasing using a minimalist, Hemingway-style approach
- Retain my personal tone and solo practice voice

Additional we're missing a key concept of my pricing model: 

- There is the base price for design and code service
- Then there are additional usage charges as follows: 
- Workshops ‚Ç¨400 per day, includes prep and workshop facilitation 
- Month 1 workshops are included up to five days 
- Additional meetings, e.g. zoom calls, ‚Ç¨150/hr when request by the client. (I may use them to speed up processes and then they're on me) 
- Additional user testing rounds after month one: ‚Ç¨1,000 - with five or six users per round, includes, prep, 1:1 remote testing, reporting and workshop on the results. 
- I've explained this before on this site - https://decommerce-proposal.vercel.app/ - you can borrow concepts from there about this being AI first, incentivising time to get the best results, etc. 

- IMPORTANT: Make sure all content is in the build plan so we don't loose anything. 


COPY FIRST DRAFT THAT NEEDS EDITING AND THEN GOING INTO THE BUILD PLAN: 

**Pricing page**

We offer a straightforward **monthly subscription** for our design+development service. It‚Äôs a flat fee that gives you a dedicated, on-call product team. **Plans start at approximately ‚Ç¨5,000 per month** for a standard engagement, which includes unlimited design/development requests (one task at a time, handled with high quality focus. If you need to accelerate more, you can scale up with additional parallel workstreams (similar to adding another ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù for a second simultaneous task). 

**No long-term contract** ‚Äì it‚Äôs strictly month-to-month, **cancel any time**. Think of it like an agile sprint: you pay for a month, we deliver as much value as possible in that time. You can renew, pause, or stop based on your needs. We‚Äôll even help estimate how many months or cycles you might need to reach your goals, so you have a clear roadmap from the start. And of course, if priorities change, you‚Äôre never locked in ‚Äì our model is as flexible as your startup needs to be.

**Calculating the monthly fee**

**‚ÄúHire us to get the job done, risk-free:** We structure our pricing around the _value and outcomes_ we deliver to your business. Instead of paying for endless hours or features you don‚Äôt need, you invest a fixed monthly amount aligned with the results you‚Äôre after. If we estimate our work will add roughly ‚Ç¨500k to your bottom line in two years, your cost would be about 20% of that over one year of our work or: ‚Ç¨8k per month for one year ‚Äì a **small fraction** of that value.

Example 1: 
Value Calculation: 
We save on your team costs by creating an application for onboarding your customers: it frees up 10% of your team times and increases revenue by 20% - ‚Ç¨300k value over two years. 
Our Fee: 
‚Ç¨300k x 20% = ‚Ç¨60k 
over 12 months = ‚Ç¨5k our fee per month 

Example 2: 
We take a workflow out of your development teams hands (one PM, one designer and two developers) costing ‚Ç¨420k over a year 
Our Fee: 
‚Ç¨400k x 20% = ‚Ç¨84k 
over 12 months = ‚Ç¨7k our fee per month 

****

And here‚Äôs the best part: **you‚Äôre free to cancel anytime**. Once you‚Äôve gotten what you need (your new product features are live and bringing in revenue, or your team is ready to take over), you can stop the engagement. 

You‚Äôll only pay a small wrap-up fee (20% of the remaining year), and you keep all the benefits delivered so far. This means we‚Äôre motivated to deliver meaningful results from month one, and you never pay for work that isn‚Äôt moving you closer to your goals. It‚Äôs a win-win: you get value early and often, and you have the flexibility to scale down when you‚Äôre satisfied.‚Äù*

We offer a flexible monthly subscription model with three plan tiers to fit your needs:

- **UI/UX Design Only** ‚Äì We design your product‚Äôs interface _in code_ and deliver a polished front-end using modern UI libraries. Perfect if you only need UX/UI design and a clickable front-end prototype.
    
- **Front-End Development** ‚Äì Custom design **plus** a front-end application built in Cursor, our AI-assisted development environment. We‚Äôll create your UX/UI and code a front-end app (documented in Storybook or using the shadcn component library) ready to plug into your backend.
    
- **Full-Stack Development** ‚Äì A complete end-to-end product. We design the UI and build the entire application in Cursor, including front-end and back-end development, delivering a fully functional app.
