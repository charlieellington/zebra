# Zebra Design Site Status & Implementation Learnings

## Project Overview

Building a one-page portfolio site for Zebra Design (Design-as-a-Service) using the Lume Studio Next.js template as a foundation. The goal is to create a high-quality, performant site by maximizing template component reuse.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15.2.3 with App Router & Turbopack
- Tailwind CSS v4 (using CSS variables)
- Shadcn UI components
- Motion primitives for animations
- TypeScript

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Environment Setup
- Forked Lume Studio template
- Created GitHub repository
- Set up development environment with pnpm
- Created feature branch (zebra-site)

### ✅ Phase 2: Initial Cleanup & Branding
- Removed unnecessary sections (Portfolio, Testimonials, Contact)
- Updated all "Lume Studio" → "Zebra Design"
- Implemented brand colors via CSS variables
- Configured smooth-scrolling one-page navigation
- Created Pricing page stub

### ✅ Phase 3: Hero Section Enhancement
- Added Zebra Design branding to header
- Implemented 4 key benefit cards with FCF8F4 background
- Updated CTAs: "Book intro call" (Cal.com) & "View examples"
- Created custom AI tool logos (Cursor, OpenAI, Claude, reMarkable)
- Optimized for mobile with responsive grids

### ✅ Phase 4: Recent Builds Section
- Created showcase of AI-built projects and design background
- Implemented hover image previews (desktop only)
- Added colored icons and build time pills
- Mobile-optimized with touch affordances

### ✅ Phase 5: Post-Hero Credo & Quick Wins
- Created Credo section with Paul Graham quote
- Implemented Quick Wins with 6 benefits grid
- Added Vanta.js trunk animation (performance-optimized)
- Integrated Shadcn Tooltips for desktop
- Mobile-friendly card layout for benefits

## Key Learnings for Faster Implementation

### 1. **Component Reuse Pattern**
```typescript
// Always check for existing components first
- src/components/sections/home/* (existing section patterns)
- src/components/ui/* (Shadcn components)
- src/components/motion-primitives/* (animations)
```
**Learning:** The template has excellent reusable components. Always explore existing patterns before creating new ones.

### 2. **Consistent Section Structure**
```tsx
<section className="py-16 md:py-32" id="section-name">
  <div className="mx-auto max-w-6xl px-6">
    <ScrollView>
      {/* Content */}
    </ScrollView>
  </div>
</section>
```
**Learning:** Use this consistent structure for all sections - it maintains rhythm and spacing.

### 3. **Animation Pattern**
```tsx
<ScrollView stagger delay={0.02}>
  {items.map((item, index) => (
    <ScrollViewStaggerWrapper key={item.id}>
      {/* Item content */}
    </ScrollViewStaggerWrapper>
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```
**Learning:** ScrollView handles all entrance animations. Use stagger for lists.

### 4. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**
```tsx
// Desktop-specific features
const [isDesktop, setIsDesktop] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  setIsDesktop(window.innerWidth >= 768);
}, []);

// Conditional rendering
{isDesktop ? <DesktopVersion /> : <MobileVersion />}
```
**Learning:** Always provide mobile alternatives for desktop-only features (tooltips → cards, hover → tap).

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
```tsx
// Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
const VantaTrunk = dynamic(() => import("@/components/vanta-trunk"), {
  ssr: false,
});

// Hardware detection
const hasGoodPerformance = navigator.hardwareConcurrency >= 4;
```
**Learning:** Use dynamic imports and hardware detection for animations/heavy features.

### 6. **Color System Usage**
```css
/* Brand colors are CSS variables in globals.css */
--background: 0 0% 100%;        /* White */
--card: 30 23% 95%;             /* #FCF8F4 */
--foreground: 240 5% 10%;       /* Near black */
--muted-foreground: 240 5% 40%; /* Gray text */
```
**Learning:** Use Tailwind's semantic color classes (bg-card, text-muted-foreground) not hex values.

### 7. **Icon Usage**
```tsx
import { Zap, Target, Euro } from "lucide-react";
// All Lucide icons are available and consistent
```
**Learning:** Lucide icons are already integrated - use them for consistency.

### 8. **Content Organization**
- Keep content in arrays/objects for easy updates
- Use TypeScript interfaces for content structure
- Separate content from presentation

### 9. **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Descriptive commits with clear scope
git commit -m "feat: implement Post-Hero Credo & Quick Wins sections

- Added Credo section with Paul Graham quote
- Created Quick Wins section with 6 key benefits
- [detailed list of changes]"
```

## Established Patterns

### Section Addition Workflow
1. Create component in `src/components/sections/home/`
2. Import and add to `src/app/page.tsx`
3. Use existing section structure and spacing
4. Add ScrollView animations
5. Test responsive behavior
6. Commit with detailed message

### Component Creation Checklist
- [ ] Check for existing similar components
- [ ] Use "use client" only when needed (state/effects)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Include mobile-specific handling
- [ ] Use semantic HTML and accessibility features
- [ ] Keep under 250 lines (split if larger)

### Testing Priorities
1. Mobile experience first
2. Performance on low-end devices
3. Animation smoothness
4. Content readability
5. Interactive element accessibility

## Next Content Sections to Implement

Based on typical one-page portfolio structure:
1. **Services/Offerings Section** - What Zebra Design provides
2. **Process Section** - How the Design-as-a-Service model works
3. **About Section** - More detailed founder story
4. **FAQ Section** - Common questions about the service
5. **CTA/Contact Section** - Final conversion push

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Add Shadcn components
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

# Install packages
pnpm add [package-name]

# Type checking
pnpm type-check
```

## Current State

- **Repository:** https://github.com/charlieellington/zebra
- **Branch:** zebra-site
- **Dev Server:** http://localhost:3000
- **Last Commit:** feat: implement Post-Hero Credo & Quick Wins sections

The site now has:
- Clean hero with AI tool branding
- Philosophy quote section (Credo)
- 6 key benefits (Quick Wins)
- Recent builds showcase
- Basic structure for remaining content

Ready for next content section implementation using established patterns.
