Thanks, Charlie. I'll create a clear, first-person 'About Me' page brief for the Zebra site. It will weave in your background, sabbatical experience, values, design and AI development fusion, and communicate your solo focus in a reassuring tone. I'll also include a subtle timeline element to show evolution and build trust. I'll let you know when it's ready.

About Me
========

Hello! I'm **Charlie Ellington** -- a product designer, creative entrepreneur, and lifelong learner. Over the past decade I've worn many hats, from digital marketer and sailing instructor to startup founder and design lead. Through it all, one thing has remained constant: I love crafting bold, user-centered designs that solve real problems. My journey has taken me from teaching sailing in my early career to leading a 40-person design team in the Web3 tech world, and now to running my own solo design practice.

My Journey
----------

-   **2008--2015:** *Finding my footing.* I began in digital marketing while pursuing my passion for the outdoors as a sailing instructor. These years taught me the importance of discipline, communication, and guiding others -- skills that still inform my work today.

-   **2013--2017:** *Entrepreneurial ventures.* I founded a yoga retreat business in Ibiza (summers) and ran ski holiday tours in winters. Building these experiences from the ground up honed my entrepreneurial spirit and showed me how design and storytelling can create memorable customer experiences.

-   **2017--2018:** *Freelance design beginnings.* Eager to pivot into tech, I started taking on freelance product design projects for early-stage startups. One of my first big breaks was designing for a Web3 startup (Nexus Mutual) -- I volunteered to redesign their site to **up-skill**, which led to paid work on their app and opened the door to many more projects. I discovered that when I'm designing digital products, I often find myself in a *flow state* -- hours can pass by effortlessly because I'm doing what I love.

-   **2018--2023:** *Studio leadership.* I founded **Deep Work**, a product design studio focused on Web3. As founder and Head of Design, I led a team of over 40 designers and worked on **40+ projects** in blockchain and fintech. Our team collaborated with founders and engineers to create bold, userâ€‘centred interfaces that drove product-market fit and growth for clients. We tackled projects for notable platforms like Ethereum 2.0, MakerDAO, and many others in the decentralized tech space. While this period was exciting and full of impact, it was also intense -- running a fast-growing studio taught me about scaling, leadership, and the importance of balance.

-   **2023:** *Sabbatical and refocus.* After years of pushing hard, I stepped away for a sabbatical. I traveled in a self-built campervan (yes, I even got obsessed with designing and building campervans as a side project!) and spent months surfing, kiteboarding, and reflecting on what mattered most. This time off was transformative. I realized that true *"energy flow"* in work comes from a sweet spot: doing **challenging, skill-building work that genuinely benefits people and the planet, while still leaving room for family, health and community**. In other words, I needed to balance meaningful work with a healthy life. I also came to terms with the fact that I'm happiest when I'm **creating** (designing solutions), not managing large teams or chasing endless business growth. This insight set the stage for my next chapter.

-   **2024--Present:** *Zebra Design -- my solo venture.* Refreshed and refocused, I launched **Zebra Design** as a one-man **design-as-a-service** studio. Now I collaborate directly with founders and technical teams to design bold, user-focused products on demand -- without the overhead of a big agency. Going solo means clients get my personal attention and expertise at every step, and I get to ensure each project aligns with my values and love for the craft. This chapter is about **staying in flow**: doing work I excel at and enjoy, while maintaining the balance I gained on sabbatical.

Philosophy & Approach
---------------------

I believe great design lives at the intersection of **empathy and bold creativity**. My approach is to unite a deep understanding of users with daring visual and product ideas -- a combination that not only delights users but also drives tangible results like product-market fit and business growth. I've always been **collaborative** in my process, working closely with founders, engineers, and other stakeholders. By facilitating workshops and listening closely, I make sure we're solving the right problems and that everyone is invested in the solution.

**Core values that guide my work:**

-   **User-Centered & Impact-Driven:** I design with the end-user in mind and strive to build products that are genuinely valuable to people -- and by extension, beneficial to our communities and planet. If a product will improve lives or make a positive impact, I'm all in.

-   **Authenticity & Transparency:** After leading a large team, I learned the importance of honesty about capabilities and teamwork. I don't believe in overselling or ego-driven design. I'll tell you what's feasible, and I credit collaboration where it's due (no lone-wolf pretenses here). This authentic approach means you know exactly who you're working with and what to expect.

-   **Flow & Balance:** My best work happens in a state of flow -- those moments when I'm so engaged in designing that it doesn't even feel like work. Achieving this consistently means structuring work in a healthy way. I prioritize routines and processes that sustain creativity (like focus blocks and even morning surf sessions) so I can bring fresh, energetic focus to my projects. I've seen firsthand that maintaining work/life balance isn't just good for me -- it leads to more creative, high-quality results for my clients too.

Solo Focus, Augmented by AI (The Future)
----------------------------------------

Today, I'm a **solo designer** with a twist: I've augmented my workflow by learning to code with the help of AI tools. In the past, not knowing how to code kept me strictly on the design side. But recently I realized that *I could overcome my lack of coding skills by leveraging modern no-code tools and a bit of help from ChatGPT*. So I dove in and started coding. Now, using AI-assisted development, I can rapidly prototype and even build out the designs I create -- bringing ideas to life faster and more seamlessly than ever.

This fusion of my **years of design experience** with new AI-powered coding abilities has unlocked a better process. Instead of throwing designs over the fence and hoping for the best, I can iterate on both design and implementation in tandem. It ensures the final product remains true to the original vision and user experience. I genuinely believe this hybrid skill set is part of the **future of design**: creatives who can both design and build, working side-by-side with AI to amplify our productivity and precision. It's an exciting time, and I'm continuously learning and experimenting with these tools to deliver even more value.

**What this means for you:** When you work with me, you get the best of both worlds -- **design** expertise that comes from a decade of diverse experience *and* the agility of modern development practices. I'm still a designer at heart (that will never change), but now I can also ensure that the vision we create doesn't get lost in translation during development. Whether it's a quick interactive prototype or a polished product UI, I can help take it across the finish line.

*Thank you for reading my story. I'm excited about where this new approach will lead and the meaningful projects yet to come. If you share similar values or have a bold idea in mind, let's connect -- I'd love to collaborate on building something great together.*
