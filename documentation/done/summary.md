# Zebra Design Portfolio Project Summary

## Project Overview
Building a one-page portfolio site for Zebra Design, a solo design practice that helps founders and teams launch digital products using AI-assisted development. The site is built on the Lume Studio Next.js template, maximizing component reuse while implementing custom branding and features.

**Key Differentiator**: "Designers That Code with AI" - showcasing the ability to design and develop simultaneously using modern AI tools.

## Current Project Status

### âœ… Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/charlieellington/zebra
- Forked and merged Lume Studio Next.js template
- Set up development environment with pnpm
- Created zebra-site branch for development

#### Phase 2: Initial Cleanup & Branding
- Removed unnecessary sections (Portfolio, Testimonials, Contact)
- Updated all branding from "Lume Studio" to "Zebra Design"
- Implemented brand color scheme:
  - Background: White/#FCF8F4 (light cream for cards)
  - Text hierarchy: #2A2A2D (headers), #494868 (secondary), #121212 (body)
  - Accent colors: #CDCBFF (purple), #E7BDD7 (pink), #FDA7A0 (coral)
- Configured one-page navigation with smooth scrolling
- Created placeholder Pricing page

#### Phase 3: Hero Section Enhancement
- Updated main heading to "Designers That Code with AI"
- Added "Zebra Design" branding to header navigation
- Implemented 4 key value propositions as styled cards
- Created custom SVG components for AI tool logos (Cursor, OpenAI, Claude, reMarkable)
- Updated CTAs:
  - Primary: "Book intro call" â†’ https://cal.com/charlieellington/zebra-call
  - Secondary: "View examples" â†’ #services (temporary)

#### Phase 4: Recent Builds Section
- Created showcase of AI-built projects and design background
- Implemented interactive hover previews showing project screenshots
- Added expandable intro/outro text with first-person narrative
- Color-coded project cards with unique icon colors
- Build time pills showing rapid development (1 week, 2 days, etc.)

#### Phase 5: Post-Hero Content Sections
- **Credo Section**: Paul Graham quote with Y Combinator branding
- **Quick Wins Section**: 6 key benefits with colorful tooltips
  - Each benefit has unique color scheme
  - Mobile: Always visible descriptions
  - Desktop: Interactive tooltips with custom styling
- **Note**: Vanta.js animations were implemented but later removed due to performance issues

### ðŸš§ Ready for Implementation

#### Step 5: Post-Recent Builds Sections (Planned)
Seven sub-steps ready for execution:
1. Launch Process Section (4-step accordion)
2. Who I Help Section (audience bullet list)
3. Pricing Section (value-based summary with abstract image)
4. Pain Points Section (problem/solution accordion)
5. FAQs Section (collapsed accordion)
6. Final CTA Section (booking call + examples buttons)
7. Integration & Testing

All content is mapped, button links are defined, and implementation details are clarified.

## Key Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Vanta.js Issue**: Beautiful animated backgrounds caused significant performance degradation
- **Solution**: Replaced with static abstract images and placeholder divs
- **Lesson**: Always prioritize performance over visual effects, especially for hero sections

### 2. Next.js & React Best Practices
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Use "use client" directive for components with browser-only features (Vanta, hover effects)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Essential for libraries that don't support SSR
- **React Strict Mode**: Can cause double initialization - implement guards for effects
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component crucial for performance with large images

### 3. Responsive Design Patterns
- **Mobile-First**: Build for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Touch Detection**: `window.ontouchstart` and `navigator.maxTouchPoints` for device-aware features
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: 
  - Mobile: Single column, simplified interactions
  - Tablet (sm/md): Intermediate layouts
  - Desktop (lg+): Full features, hover effects, multi-column grids

### 4. Component Architecture
- **Shadcn UI**: Excellent for rapid development with customizable primitives
- **Color System**: Use CSS variables for consistent theming (Tailwind v4 approach)
- **Reusability**: Maximize template component reuse before creating custom components

### 5. UX Enhancements
- **Tooltips**: 
  - Desktop: Hover tooltips for additional info
  - Mobile: Always visible or tap-to-show
  - Custom styling with TooltipPrimitive for brand consistency
- **Expandable Text**: Clean inline expansion without visual clutter
- **Hover Previews**: Mouse-following images enhance project showcases

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Clean Minimalism**: White backgrounds with subtle #FCF8F4 accents
2. **Color Usage**:
   - #FCF8F4: Background tints only
   - #E7BDD7, #CDCBFF: Icon/text highlights (not backgrounds)
   - Project-specific colors for visual distinction
3. **Typography**: Consistent sizing with clear hierarchy (base â†’ lg â†’ xl â†’ 2xl)

### Interactive Elements
1. **Hover States**: Subtle scale transforms (105-110%) with smooth transitions
2. **Click Targets**: Large touch areas for mobile (minimum 44px)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Border changes, color shifts, shadow effects on interaction

### Content Strategy
1. **First-Person Voice**: "I" instead of "we" - emphasizing solo practice
2. **Hemingway Style**: Short sentences, clear messaging, no fluff
3. **Proof Points**: Specific timeframes (1 week, 2 days) for credibility

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Template Cleanup**: Successfully removed unnecessary sections while preserving reusable components
2. **Performance Issues**: Identified and removed Vanta.js animations that were slowing down the site
3. **Brand Consistency**: Unified color scheme across all components with careful palette application
4. **Mobile Experience**: Ensured all interactions work on touch devices without hover states

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Execute Step 5 implementation (7 sub-steps for remaining homepage sections)
2. Optimize abstract images (currently 7-9MB each)
3. Update "View examples" link once examples section exists

### Future Enhancements
1. Consider lightweight CSS/SVG animations as Vanta alternatives
2. Add case study pages for Recent Builds projects
3. Implement actual booking integration beyond Cal.com link
4. Create detailed pricing calculator on Pricing page

### Technical Debt
1. Abstract images need optimization (use image optimization tools)
2. Some placeholder links need real destinations
3. Consider lazy loading for below-fold sections
