Developer Plan for the "Recent Builds" Section
==============================================

**Objective:** Implement a new **Recent Builds** section right after the hero on the homepage, using the existing Lume Studio Next.js template components and Tailwind styling. This section will highlight recent projects in two categories (Built with AI and Design Background) with minimal new code, maintaining a clean, personal, and authentic style.

Rewritten Section Intro (Hemingway Style)
-----------------------------------------

Introduce the section with a brief, impactful tagline that reflects the founder's philosophy and experience, rewritten in a clear "Hemingway" style for simplicity and punch. For example:

> **Founder-led. Design-centric. Outcome-driven.** I founded Zebra Design after more than a decade of launching early-stage products as a product designer. My approach is grounded in experience and focused on delivering real results.

This intro copy should feel personal (using "I") and authentic, setting the tone for the content that follows. It will appear as a lead-in paragraph or tagline at the top of the Recent Builds section, just below the section heading (if any). Use the same text styles as other section intros in the template (likely a larger or bold font for the short phrases, followed by a normal text sentence) for consistency.

Section Layout and Design Approach
----------------------------------

-   **Structure:** Use a single container (e.g., a `<section>` or `<div>`) for the Recent Builds section, similar to how other sections (About, Services, etc.) are structured in the template. Maintain the template's spacing and breakpoints (e.g. use the same Tailwind utility classes for padding/margins as used in other sections to ensure consistent look and responsive behavior).

-   **Two Subsections:** Within this section, divide content into two clear parts: **"Built with AI"** and **"Design Background."** Label each part with a subtitle or heading (for example, an `<h3>` or styled label text) to clearly differentiate them. Use a style consistent with other subtitles or category labels in the site (perhaps a small caps or muted-color label or a regular heading). This could be as simple as a bold heading above each list, or a pill-style tag -- whichever fits the template's design patterns.

-   **Layout:** For a clean, minimalist look, consider using a two-column layout on larger screens to display the two subsections side by side. For example, a responsive grid with two columns (e.g., `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8`) can place **Built with AI** on the left and **Design Background** on the right. On mobile, these will stack vertically (the grid will collapse to one column). This approach keeps both categories visible in one view on desktop, while remaining mobile-friendly. Ensure adequate whitespace between and around these columns, following the template's spacing scale for a uncluttered feel.

-   **Component Reuse:** Leverage existing components or patterns from the template to avoid writing new CSS or markup from scratch. The Lume Studio template is built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI, which likely includes reusable card or list styles. For instance, if there's a **Card** component (from Shadcn UI) or a pre-designed list item style, use that for each project entry. This ensures visual consistency and speeds up development. If no specific card component exists, you can create a simple card-like `<div>` with Tailwind classes (e.g., a border, rounded corners, background on hover, etc.) consistent with the template's aesthetic. The goal is to make these project items feel like part of the original design.

-   **Typography & Style:** Match the typography hierarchy of the template:

    -   Project titles should use a heading style similar to how service titles or portfolio item titles are styled (perhaps an `h4` or `h5` with bold text).

    -   Subtext (like the project subtitle or role description) can use the body text style or a slightly smaller, muted text if that pattern exists (check how the template lists things like team roles or service descriptions and mimic that).

    -   The "Built in X time" note can be in a secondary text style (perhaps italic or small font) to set it apart without dominating attention.

-   **Icons/Images:** Include **placeholder icons or logos** for each item to add visual interest, but keep them minimal since we don't have actual graphics yet. You might use a generic icon component (from an icon library already in use, or a simple SVG/emoji) or a neutral image (like a gray square or an initial) as a stand-in:

    -   For **Built with AI** cards, a simple icon (e.g., a gear, robot, or spark icon) could precede the title or sit above it.

    -   For **Design Background** items, use placeholder logos (e.g., a briefcase icon or a generic building icon) or even the company's first letter in a styled box.\
        Ensure these icons are sized and colored consistently with the template's style (for example, if other sections use 40px monochrome icons, do the same here). Keep icons subtle so they support the content without overpowering it.

-   **Visual Separation:** Clearly separate the two subsections either by a vertical divider or distinct headings. A simple approach is to rely on the headings ("Built with AI" and "Design Background") and some extra spacing between the two lists. Optionally, you could use a slight background shade difference for each subsection's container (if it fits the style) or a thin divider line, but this may not be necessary if spacing and headings make it clear. Minimalism is key: use just enough UI to differentiate the parts, nothing more.

Subsection 1: **Built with AI** Projects
----------------------------------------

This subsection will showcase projects that were **built with AI**, using static card elements for each project. Each card will contain the project title, a short one-line subtitle, and a note about how quickly it was built. We will include three projects here:

-   **Therapist AI Tool** -- *"Call room: client talks, bot transcribes, AI-generated hints for therapist."* *Built in 1 week.*\
    *(This card can use a placeholder icon representing an AI or chat tool. The title is the project name; the subtitle describes its function in a concise way; the build time note emphasizes the quick turnaround.)*

-   **Waitlist Platform** -- *"Capture early adopters for any product."* *Built in 2 days.*\
    *(A placeholder icon (e.g., a list or users icon) can accompany this. Subtitle highlights the purpose of the platform. The build time "2 days" underscores the speed of execution, perhaps styled in italics or a secondary text color.)*

-   **Sunni Photo Concept** -- *"My first AI project to learn databases and experiment with processes."* *Built in two weeks.*\
    *(Use a placeholder icon, maybe a camera or database icon, to hint at a photo project. The subtitle adds a personal note --- indicating it was a learning experiment --- which adds authenticity. Build time is noted as "two weeks".)*

**Design Notes for "Built with AI" Cards:** Arrange these three cards in a consistent style:

-   Perhaps use a simple flex or grid to make them evenly spaced. For example, a three-column grid on desktop (`grid-cols-3`) or a vertical stack on mobile.

-   Each card can have a light background or subtle border (if such styling exists in the template's cards) to stand out from the section background. Keep the look clean (e.g., a slight hover elevation or border-color change using Tailwind classes if interactive, or static if they're just display).

-   Pad each card with Tailwind spacing classes (e.g., `p-4` or `p-6`) consistent with other cards in the site.

-   The title text should be prominent. The subtitle can be in quotation marks or italic to denote it as a short description (quotes are optional -- they were provided in content but you might drop them in the actual UI if it looks cleaner). The build time note should be visually de-emphasized (smaller or lighter text) so it serves as a footnote.

-   Ensure alignment and typography match the template: likely left-aligned, with titles maybe in the brand font weight and color. Use the same text color palette as elsewhere (e.g., the template might use a gray-700 for body text, etc.).

Subsection 2: **Design Background** Roles
-----------------------------------------

The second part of Recent Builds highlights **design-led roles or past design experiences** of the founder, presented in a similar list or card format. This gives credibility by showing key design positions held. Each item here will list the company/organization and a short note on the contribution or significance. Use the same styling as the AI project cards for consistency (perhaps slightly modified if needed to indicate these are roles, not builds). We will include the following entries:

-   **Deep Work Studio** -- *Web3's leading product design studio.*

-   **Ethereum Foundation** -- *Designed the transition to eth2.0 staking.*

-   **Ramp Network** -- *Raised $120M off the product I designed.*

-   **Nexus Mutual** -- *Web3 insurance UI before web3 patterns existed.*

-   **And many more...** -- *(This serves as a hint that the list continues beyond these examples, reinforcing that there are additional relevant experiences. It can be styled in italics or with an ellipsis to indicate continuation.)*

Each of the first four items can be presented similarly to the AI project cards: a placeholder logo or icon plus the name and subtitle. For example, use a generic company/building icon or briefcase icon as the placeholder for each (until real logos or graphics are added). The subtitles are brief phrases highlighting either the nature of the organization or the impact of the work:

-   Keep the text concise, as given (one line each). They already have a personal tone ("product I designed", etc.) where appropriate.

-   Unlike the AI builds, we do **not** include a time note here (since these were roles or ongoing design engagements, not quick builds). This means these cards might have slightly less text. To maintain balance, you could center the content a bit more vertically or just accept the varying content length (which is fine in a flexbox or grid layout).

-   The last item "And many more..." can be styled as a final list item but non-clickable. You might italicize it or use an ellipsis to make it feel more like a note rather than a normal entry. This could even be just plain text at the end of the list without an icon, to visually differentiate it as a footnote. For instance, you could indent it or offset it to show it's not a normal entry (optional design choice).

**Design Notes for "Design Background" List:**

-   Use the same column layout approach as **Built with AI** for consistency. If you used a three-column grid for AI projects, you might use a two-column for these items if that fits better (since we have four main items). On desktop, a two-by-two grid could work nicely for the four roles (two items per row), and on mobile they'd stack. If the AI section is next to it in a two-column layout, then the Design Background list will just occupy its own column --- within that, you can still format the items in two columns internally or one per line. However, keeping them one per line (a vertical list) might be simpler and cleaner, given each has a short phrase. A vertical list with each role on its own line (with a subtle divider or extra margin between) could read like a resume highlight list.

-   Keep styling similar to cards, or if you prefer a simpler list style (maybe no borders, just icon and text per item), that could also differentiate that these are roles, not project case studies. For example, a row layout: [icon] [Company Name -- subtitle]. This would resemble a timeline of experiences.

-   Ensure the **"Design Background"** subsection heading or label is clearly visible (same style as "Built with AI" label). This way, even if the two lists are in one column vertically, the reader can instantly tell which is which.

Implementation Steps
--------------------

1.  **Add Section Wrapper:** In the homepage (likely `app/page.tsx` or relevant page component), insert a new section component or HTML `<section>` for **Recent Builds** right below the Hero section component. Apply existing section classes (e.g., a Tailwind container class like `mx-auto max-w-7xl py-16` or similar, matching spacing used in About/Services sections for vertical rhythm).

2.  **Section Heading/Intro:** If the design calls for a section title (some templates have an H2 for sections like "Recent Work" or similar), include a heading like `## Recent Builds` aligned with the template's style. This could be optional if the intro text serves as the title. However, to be clear, you might add a small overline or title (e.g., a muted "Recent Builds" label above the intro, or just use the intro text as the attention-grabber). Immediately below, place the rewritten intro text. For example:

    -   Use an `<p>` or appropriate component for the intro copy: *Founder-led. Design-centric. Outcome-driven...* (the Hemingway-style text from above).\
        Ensure this text uses the same font and size as other section intros (it might be the same class as the hero subtitle or about section intro). Keep the sentences separated by periods as shown, which gives a punchy, minimalist feel.

3.  **Built with AI Subsection:** Create a subdiv container (e.g., `<div class="mt-8">`) for the **Built with AI** list.

    -   Add a label or heading for this subsection: e.g. `<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Built with AI</h3>` (adjust classes to match template's design for subheadings or use an existing component if available).

    -   For each project in the **Built with AI** list, add a card or list item:

        -   If using a Card component (from Shadcn UI or a custom one), you might do something like:

            ```
            <Card>
              <CardHeader className="flex items-center">
                <Icon name="placeholder-icon" className="mr-2" />
                <CardTitle>Therapist AI Tool</CardTitle>
              </CardHeader>
              <CardContent>
                <CardDescription>"Call room: client talks, bot transcribes, AI-generated hints for therapist."</CardDescription>
              </CardContent>
              <CardFooter>
                <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Built in 1 week</span>
              </CardFooter>
            </Card>

            ```

            *(Note: class names like `text-muted-foreground` assume shadcn's design tokens; adjust according to actual CSS in use.)*\
            Using the Card's header/content/footer slots is one way; or simply structure a `<div>`:

            ```
            <div class="p-4 border rounded-lg flex flex-col">
              <div class="flex items-center font-semibold">
                <PlaceholderIcon class="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-primary"/>
                Therapist AI Tool
              </div>
              <p class="text-sm mt-1">Call room: client talks, bot transcribes, AI-generated hints for therapist.</p>
              <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">Built in 1 week</p>
            </div>

            ```

            Do this for **Waitlist Platform** and **Sunni Photo Concept** as well, updating the text accordingly. Keep the markup consistent for all three.

    -   Use the template's utilities for spacing and typography. For example, if the template uses a specific utility or component for section lists, prefer that. Make sure each card has some margin-bottom if stacked vertically, or specify grid columns if showing them in one row. Given three items, a single row on desktop could work nicely (each card taking equal width).

4.  **Design Background Subsection:** Below the AI cards (or to the right if using a two-column grid), create another container for **Design Background** experiences.

    -   Add a subsection heading, e.g., `<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Design Background</h3>` (using a top margin to space it from the previous content, unless using grid).

    -   List the design roles/companies. You can use a similar card or list item style, or a slightly simpler list style since these might be seen as career highlights:

        -   For consistency, you could use the same card structure without the footer (since there's no "Built in X"). Each card would then have just an icon, title, and description. Example (using the simple div approach):

            ```
            <div class="p-4 border rounded-lg flex items-center">
              <PlaceholderLogo class="w-6 h-6 mr-3 text-primary" />
              <div>
                <div class="font-semibold">Deep Work Studio</div>
                <div class="text-sm text-gray-700">Web3's leading product design studio.</div>
              </div>
            </div>

            ```

            This puts the icon and text in one line (for a compact list feel). Alternatively, if you want them stacked like the AI cards:

            ```
            <div class="p-4 border rounded-lg">
              <div class="flex items-center font-semibold mb-1">
                <PlaceholderLogo class="w-5 h-5 mr-2 text-primary"/>
                Deep Work Studio
              </div>
              <p class="text-sm">Web3's leading product design studio.</p>
            </div>

            ```

        -   Repeat for **Ethereum Foundation**, **Ramp Network**, **Nexus Mutual**. Each subtitle is one line as given. Ensure the text fits on small screens (the phrases are short enough, but if any line is long, it will wrap naturally).

        -   For **"And many more..."**: you can include this as a final list item without an icon to differentiate it. For example:

            ```
            <div class="p-4 italic text-sm text-gray-600">And many more...</div>

            ```

            Or simply a text element below the list:

            ```
            <p class="mt-2 italic text-sm text-gray-600">And many more...</p>

            ```

            This indicates that the list is not exhaustive. Keeping it italic and gray will make it feel like an aside note.

    -   If using a grid for these items (say two columns), ensure the order flows correctly (in HTML, list them in logical order; CSS grid will place them row-wise). Alternatively, a vertical list is fine -- just add margin between each item (e.g., `mb-4` on each card) and maybe a subtle divider if that suits the style.

5.  **Styling Consistency:** After structuring the HTML/JSX, verify that the new section inherits the global styles:

    -   The background should likely remain the default (white or dark if in dark mode, etc., matching other sections).

    -   Text colors and font families should be those already defined by the template's theme (e.g., use classes like `text-gray-800` or the preconfigured text colors, rather than hardcoding any new colors).

    -   Headings for the subsections should possibly use the same style as other section subheadings. If the template had a component or class for section sub-titles (like a colored stripe or uppercase text), apply that here.

    -   Use **minimal custom CSS**. Ideally, everything can be done with Tailwind utility classes and existing components. For example, the template might already have utility classes or configured design tokens for spacing, font sizes, etc. Stick to those to ensure the design remains cohesive.

    -   Keep the overall look minimalist: plenty of whitespace, concise text, and simple visuals (icons only). No extra flourishes or heavy graphics should be added in line with "minimalist best practices" -- let the content (project titles and the short descriptions) speak for itself, with just enough styling to differentiate elements (like making titles bold and subtitles normal weight).

6.  **Copy Tone Check:** Double-check that the tone of all text in this section feels personal and authentic:

    -   The intro already uses first person ("I founded...") which is good. It establishes a personal voice.

    -   The project subtitles like "My first AI project to learn databases..." also add personal context, which is great. Leave that phrasing as-is, since it reflects a personal learning experience.

    -   The Design Background items could optionally be phrased in first person (e.g., "I led design for Web3's leading product design studio"), but the provided copy is already concise and impactful. It's okay to list the organization and a claim-to-fame in third person as given. This actually can read like proud bullet points on a CV. To inject a bit more personal feel, you might consider tiny tweaks like "(product I designed)" as they have for Ramp Network, which is already in first person. The others are fine as statements of fact.

    -   Ensure no marketing buzzwords beyond those needed; the text is straightforward now, which aligns with a Hemingway style (e.g., "Web3's leading product design studio" is a strong, simple claim).

7.  **Responsive Testing:** Once implemented, test the section at different breakpoints:

    -   On mobile, the intro text and each list should stack nicely (the two subsections one after the other). Make sure the icons and text don't overflow the screen (Tailwind's responsive classes can adjust font size or spacing if needed for very small screens).

    -   On desktop, if side by side, verify that the columns have balanced spacing. If one column is much longer, consider breaking the longer one into two columns internally or simply accept vertical space (which is fine). In this case, **Design Background** has 5 lines (including "And many more"), and **Built with AI** has 3 slightly larger cards. The heights might be comparable, but if not, that's okay -- the section can have uneven column heights without issue. The important part is it looks good and is easy to scan.

    -   Check that the section doesn't clash with the hero above or any section below. There should be sufficient padding (likely already given by the section container classes). The intro text should be distinguishable from the hero text -- since it's smaller and lower on the page, that should naturally be the case.

8.  **Minimal Code Addition:** All of the above can be achieved with minimal new code:

    -   Mostly you will be writing JSX/HTML to insert the content. The styling uses existing Tailwind classes and maybe Shadcn UI components. You shouldn't need to add new CSS files or do extensive customization.

    -   If any small custom styles are needed (for example, if the template didn't cover a particular style like the italic note for "And many more..."), you can add utility classes or inline style as a last resort. But generally Tailwind should cover it (e.g., `italic text-sm text-gray-600` covers the styling without custom CSS).

    -   By reusing the template's components, you maintain consistency and reduce the chance of introducing design bugs. For instance, if the template has a pre-built card or list item component, use it directly and just feed in our content as props/children.

Summary
-------

In summary, the **Recent Builds** section will be a **clean, organized showcase** of the user's latest AI-built projects and previous design roles. It will follow the template's design system closely -- using the same fonts, spacing, and component styles -- so that it integrates seamlessly with the rest of the site. Two clearly labeled subsections ("Built with AI" and "Design Background") ensure the content is logically separated and easy to scan. The copy is succinct and personal, introduced by a strong founder statement. By sticking to a minimalist layout (simple cards, modest icons, plenty of white space), we highlight the content itself and the impressive outcomes (quick build times and impactful roles) without distraction. This plan ensures we include all provided content and achieve a cohesive section with minimal new code.
