Build Plan for Zebra Design Hero Section
========================================

To implement the **Zebra Design** header/hero quickly, we will reuse the existing Next.js template's hero component structure and Tailwind CSS styling. Below are the detailed steps:

1.  **Leverage the Template's Hero Structure**: Start with the template's pre-built **HeroSection** component (ensuring any background/animation is retained for visual appeal). This template already provides a full-screen hero layout with smooth animations and responsiveness out of the box. By using the same component, we inherit the existing CSS classes and layout (e.g. centered content, padding, and any background video or gradient) without writing from scratch. This forms the basic container for our content and guarantees consistent styling with the rest of the site.

2.  **Set the Headings and Intro Text**: Replace the placeholder text in the hero with our branding and tagline. For the main heading, use **"Zebra Design"** and **"Designers That Code with AI"** as a two-line title. For example, you can make "Zebra Design" an `<h1>` and the tagline a styled `<p>` or `<span>` right below it (the template's `TextEffect` component can be used to animate these lines, similar to how it showcased its demo tagline). Ensure the heading uses responsive font sizes (e.g. `text-5xl md:text-7xl` in Tailwind) so it looks prominent on desktop and scales down on mobile. Below the title/tagline, add the one-sentence description: *"I help you launch your digital product faster -- design and coded -- through a user-focused partnership."* Style this as a subtitle paragraph (e.g. `text-lg text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto` similar to the template's subtitle) so it's centered and comfortably readable on all screens.

3.  **Include the Key Bullet Points**: Under the intro text, present the four key points as a concise list of benefits. Use an unordered list with bullet styling (Tailwind's `list-disc list-inside` or custom icons for a polished look). The points are:\
    -- *"Idea → tested product in weeks, not months"*\
    -- *"I handle both design and development"*\
    -- *"Made for startup founders, SMEs, and product teams"*\
    -- *"A design-as-a-service model to design and develop your app lightning-fast"*\
    Structure these in a column on small screens and consider a two-column layout on larger screens for brevity (e.g. using a flex or grid with `md:grid-cols-2` so that two bullets appear in each column on desktop). This keeps the hero from becoming too tall while still showing all points. Use adequate spacing (`mt-4` for top margin on the list, and `mb-6` after) so it doesn't visually merge with the intro text or CTAs. By using Tailwind utilities and the template's existing spacing scale, we ensure the list adopts the site's consistent spacing and typography quickly.

4.  **Add Call-To-Action Buttons**: Next, insert the two CTA buttons below the bullet points. We will reuse the template's Button component (from shadcn/UI) for consistent style. Create a primary button for **"Book intro call"** and a secondary button for **"View examples."** Use the same wrapper and classes as the template's hero buttons for styling: for instance, wrap the primary button in a subtle border container if the template did (to achieve the layered effect seen in the original hero). The primary button should be a filled style (default or "primary" variant) with a large size (`size="lg"`, and Tailwind classes like `rounded-xl px-5 text-base` to match the template). Set its link to the scheduling URL (e.g. your Cal.com link) and add `target="_blank"` if you want it to open in a new tab. The secondary button should use the **ghost/outline** variant (as the template did for its second button), with the same large size and rounded style. This **"View examples"** button will scroll to the examples section on the page -- implement this by using an anchor link (`href="#examples"`) or Next.js Link to the section ID. The template's layout already handles button placement responsively: it uses a flex container that stacks vertically on mobile and side-by-side on desktop. By copying that structure, on small screens the buttons will appear one above the other (easy to tap with a finger) and on larger screens they'll sit next to each other with proper spacing (usually a gap of `.gap-2` or similar). Use concise, action-oriented text on the buttons and ensure the primary CTA stands out visually (e.g. solid background) while the secondary is more subtle, following hero best practices.

5.  **Integrate Official Tool Logos**: Finally, showcase the **tools logos (Cursor, OpenAI, Claude, reMarkable)** directly in the hero to emphasize the "designers that code with AI" angle. We'll fetch official SVG assets for each brand for clarity and professionalism:

    -   **Cursor**: Use Cursor's official logo SVG (available via their site ).

    -   **OpenAI**: Use the OpenAI "blossom" icon or wordmark from OpenAI's brand assets (OpenAI provides downloadable logos on their branding page).

    -   **Claude (Anthropic)**: Include the Claude AI logo; an official SVG can be obtained (the logo on Claude's site is used in Wikimedia, confirming its source is Anthropic's official design).

    -   **reMarkable**: Use the official **reMarkable** logo (from reMarkable's press or brand resources -- typically their logotype in SVG form).

    Once logos are obtained, import or add them to the project (e.g. put the SVG files in the public/assets folder or inline them as React components). Reuse the template's **LogoCloud** pattern to display these logos in a row. In the original hero, a `<LogoCloud />` component was placed under the CTAs -- we can modify that or create a similar flex container. For example, create a simple flex wrapper (`flex items-center justify-center gap-8 flex-wrap`) and insert each logo SVG with a fixed height (e.g. `h-8` or `h-10` for uniform size). This will show all tool logos side by side, wrapping if needed on smaller screens. Optionally, add a small preceding label like **"Tools:"** for context, styled in a subtle way, or rely on the icons' recognizability. Because these are official SVGs, they will scale without quality loss and match any theme (you can apply a CSS filter to recolor if the site uses dark mode, or ensure the logos are in a single-color format if needed). By using the official assets, we maintain brand consistency and clarity for users. Ensure each image has appropriate `alt` text (e.g. "Cursor logo", "OpenAI logo", etc.) for accessibility.

6.  **Optimize for Mobile & Best Practices**: Verify the hero section looks great and performs well on all devices. The template is already **fully responsive**, but our additions need checking:

    -   **Responsive text**: Confirm the main title and tagline use responsive sizing (the template's classes handle this). The content should remain center-aligned and legible on small screens (consider slightly reducing margins/padding on very small devices so that all content, including the bullet list, fits without excessive scrolling).

    -   **Bullet list on mobile**: On a phone, the four bullet points will naturally stack vertically (which is fine). Ensure there's enough line height (`leading-relaxed`) and spacing between each point for readability. On larger screens, if using two columns, verify the columns have equal item distribution and proper gap.

    -   **CTA buttons on mobile**: Because we used the template's flex-col for mobile, the **Book intro call** and **View examples** buttons will stack with a gap -- test that they're easily tappable with thumb (use a minimum touch height of ~48px which our large Button component provides). On desktop, check that the gap between them (if using `md:flex-row gap-2`) looks balanced and that the primary button is visually distinct.

    -   **Logo section**: For the tool logos, use flex wrap so that if four logos can't fit in one line on a smaller device, they wrap onto a new line rather than overflow or shrink too small. Typically, setting a max-width or using `%/vw` units can ensure they resize. Test on a narrow screen: each logo should still be recognizable (you might use `h-6` on very small screens via a media query or responsive class and `h-8` or `h-10` on larger screens). Also maintain some top margin (`mt-8` or more) above the logos so they aren't jammed against the buttons -- in the template, there was extra spacing for the logo cloud on larger screens (`sm:mt-12 md:mt-20` in the code, which we can emulate).

    -   **Performance**: If the template's hero includes a video background (`hero-light.mp4` was used), ensure it's optimized or consider using a static image/gradient if performance is a concern for mobile. However, reusing it is fastest -- just ensure an overlay or filter keeps text readable (the template already applies opacity/filter on the video for contrast). If needed, adjust the brightness for the "Designers That Code with AI" text to stand out.

    -   **Accessibility & SEO**: Use proper semantic HTML -- the main **Zebra Design** tagline should be in an `<h1>` for SEO. Subsequent text can be `<p>` or lower headings. The bullet points could be in a list for semantic grouping. All interactive elements (links, buttons) should have descriptive text and appropriate `aria-label` if needed (e.g. the Cal.com link should indicate it opens scheduling). Alt attributes on the logos, as mentioned, will also help screen readers understand that those are tool names.

    -   **Testing**: Finally, preview the hero section in multiple viewports (Chrome dev tools or a tool like Responsively) to confirm it appears balanced. Check that nothing overflows horizontally (especially the logo row), and that spacing feels consistent with the rest of the site's sections. Because we stuck to the template's utility classes and components, the design should already align with best practices and a cohesive style.

By following these steps, the header section will be built efficiently using mostly existing template components and styles. The end result is a hero that clearly communicates your value proposition, features your unique selling points, and includes strong calls-to-action -- all while looking professional and mobile-optimized thanks to the template's responsive design and the use of official, high-quality assets for the logos. This approach ensures a fast build with minimal custom CSS, since we're **reusing as much as possible** from the template, and focuses on content integration and slight tweaks rather than reinventing the layout. The hero will immediately inform visitors about **"Designers That Code with AI"** and invite them to engage (schedule a call or view examples), setting a solid first impression for the Zebra Design site.
