## Background & Motivation
Building the Zebra Design one-page portfolio site using the Lume Studio Next.js template. Zebra Design helps founders and teams launch digital products—designed and coded—faster than thought possible. The site will showcase the Design-as-a-Service model with a single-page layout and separate Pricing page. The goal is to efficiently create a high-quality front-end by reusing template components and minimizing bugs.

## Key Challenges
1. **Template Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary sections (Team, Testimonials, Portfolio, Contact) while preserving reusable components
2. **Branding Updates**: Replace all Lume Studio references with Zebra Design branding
3. **Theme Customization**: Implement monochromatic theme with light background and dark text
4. **Navigation**: Convert multi-page navigation to smooth-scrolling one-page layout
5. **Component Reuse**: Maximize use of existing template components to avoid reinventing the wheel

## High-level Task Breakdown
### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Repository Fork
- Create new GitHub repository for Zebra Design project
- Fork the Lume Studio template from https://github.com/haramishra/lume-studio-next
- Set up development environment with Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Verify tech stack (Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI)
- Create feature branch for development

### Phase 2: Initial Cleanup and Branding Updates  
- Remove unneeded pages/sections from template
- Update all branding to Zebra Design
- Implement brand color scheme:
  - White background with #FCF8F4 card highlights
  - Text colors: #2A2A2D (headers), #494868 (secondary), #121212 (body)
  - Accent colors: #CDCBFF (purple), #E7BDD7 (pink), #FDA7A0 (coral)
- Configure one-page navigation with smooth scrolling
- Create Pricing page stub

### Phase 3: Hero Section Enhancement (Planning)
Currently reviewing step2-hero.md plan and preparing for implementation:

### Fixed Responsive Layout Issue - Header and Logo Cloud Overlap
Resolved an issue where the "Powered by the best tools" section was overlapping with the header at certain screen widths:

1. **Header Component Enhancement**:
   - Added a spacer div (h-16 on mobile, h-20 on desktop) before the fixed header
   - Changed header positioning from `fixed z-20` to `fixed top-0 z-20`
   - This creates proper layout flow and prevents content from sliding under the header

2. **Hero Section Spacing Adjustment**:
   - Reduced padding-top from pt-24/md:pt-36 to pt-8/md:pt-12/lg:pt-16
   - Removed duplicate spacing since header now has its own spacer
   - Adjusted LogoCloud margin-top for better responsive spacing

3. **LogoCloud Component Improvements**:
   - Made "Powered by the best tools" text visible on all screen sizes (was hidden on non-xl)
   - Improved responsive layout: centered text on mobile, right-aligned on desktop
   - Adjusted padding from py-16 to py-8/md:py-12/lg:py-16 for better proportions
   - Added margin-bottom to text on mobile for better spacing

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/header.tsx (added spacer div and top-0 positioning)
- src/components/sections/home/hero-section.tsx (adjusted padding and margins)
- src/components/sections/home/logo-cloud.tsx (improved responsive text visibility)

**Result**: The header and content sections now maintain proper spacing at all viewport widths, preventing any overlap issues.

## Lessons
- CONTRIBUTING.md defines core principles, roles, workflow, coding etiquette, secret handling, and project folder separation.
- The assistant treats the CONTRIBUTING.md rules as persistent top-of-mind guidance and ensures responses comply, even if the file is not reread verbatim each time.
- step1-setup.md provides comprehensive instructions for the initial setup phases
- Zebra Design brand colors: White/#FCF8F4 backgrounds, #2A2A2D/#494868/#121212 text hierarchy, #CDCBFF/#E7BDD7/#FDA7A0 accents
- Template source should be https://github.com/haramishra/lume-studio-next
- Meta title: "Zebra Design — Designers That Code with AI"
- Meta description: "I help you launch a digital product—designed and coded—faster than you thought possible. Idea → tested product in weeks, not months. Design-as-a-Service for startup founders, SMEs, and product teams."
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses CSS variables for colors (no tailwind.config file needed)
- Phase 2 changes focused on minimal modifications to preserve template component reusability

## Current Project Status

### Recently Completed (Step 5)
✅ Removed all Vanta.js animations (performance issues)
✅ Implemented all Step 5 sections:
   - Launch Process (with dynamic image on hover)
   - Who I Help
   - Pricing
   - Pain Points
   - FAQs
   - Final CTA
✅ Mobile optimization for all sections
✅ Fixed header/logo overlap with spacer div
✅ **Optimized abstract PNG images (NEW)**
   - Reduced from 7-9MB to under 500KB each
   - Created WebP versions for better performance
   - Implemented OptimizedImage component for WebP with PNG fallback
   - All images now properly optimized

### Technical Details

#### Image Optimization Solution
- Installed `sharp` package for image processing
- Created optimization script at `scripts/optimize-images.js`
- Backed up original images to `public/images/originals/`
- Generated both WebP and optimized PNG versions:
  - WebP: 267KB - 456KB (82-91% reduction)
  - PNG: 285KB - 444KB (significant reduction)
- Created `OptimizedImage` component at `src/components/ui/optimized-image.tsx`
- Updated components to use WebP with PNG fallback:
  - LaunchProcessSection
  - FinalCTASection
  - PricingSection
  - FullVersionSection

### Next Steps
- Continue with any additional features or improvements
- Consider implementing image lazy loading for further performance gains
- Monitor Core Web Vitals to ensure performance improvements

### Notes
- Original abstract images are preserved in `public/images/originals/` if needed
- The services.tsx component uses MorphingDialogImage which may have its own optimization
- WebP format provides better compression while maintaining quality
- All optimized images are under the 500KB target
