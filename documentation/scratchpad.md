## Background & Motivation
Building the Zebra Design one-page portfolio site using the Lume Studio Next.js template. Zebra Design helps founders and teams launch digital products—designed and coded—faster than thought possible. The site will showcase the Design-as-a-Service model with a single-page layout and separate Pricing page. The goal is to efficiently create a high-quality front-end by reusing template components and minimizing bugs.

## Key Challenges
1. **Template Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary sections (Team, Testimonials, Portfolio, Contact) while preserving reusable components
2. **Branding Updates**: Replace all Lume Studio references with Zebra Design branding
3. **Theme Customization**: Implement monochromatic theme with light background and dark text
4. **Navigation**: Convert multi-page navigation to smooth-scrolling one-page layout
5. **Component Reuse**: Maximize use of existing template components to avoid reinventing the wheel

## High-level Task Breakdown
### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Repository Fork
- Create new GitHub repository for Zebra Design project
- Fork the Lume Studio template from https://github.com/haramishra/lume-studio-next
- Set up development environment with Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Verify tech stack (Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI)
- Create feature branch for development

### Phase 2: Initial Cleanup and Branding Updates  
- Remove unneeded pages/sections from template
- Update all branding to Zebra Design

### Fixed Responsive Layout Issue - Header and Logo Cloud Overlap
Resolved an issue where the "Powered by the best tools" section was overlapping with the header at certain screen widths:

1. **Header Component Enhancement**:
   - Added a spacer div (h-16 on mobile, h-20 on desktop) before the fixed header
   - Changed header positioning from `fixed z-20` to `fixed top-0 z-20`
   - This creates proper layout flow and prevents content from sliding under the header

2. **Hero Section Spacing Adjustment**:
   - Reduced padding-top from pt-24/md:pt-36 to pt-8/md:pt-12/lg:pt-16
   - Removed duplicate spacing since header now has its own spacer
   - Adjusted LogoCloud margin-top for better responsive spacing

3. **LogoCloud Component Improvements**:
   - Made "Powered by the best tools" text visible on all screen sizes (was hidden on non-xl)
   - Improved responsive layout: centered text on mobile, right-aligned on desktop
   - Adjusted padding from py-16 to py-8/md:py-12/lg:py-16 for better proportions
   - Added margin-bottom to text on mobile for better spacing

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/header.tsx (added spacer div and top-0 positioning)
- src/components/sections/home/hero-section.tsx (adjusted padding and margins)
- src/components/sections/home/logo-cloud.tsx (improved responsive text visibility)

**Result**: The header and content sections now maintain proper spacing at all viewport widths, preventing any overlap issues.

### Expandable Text Animation Enhancement ✅
Added smooth easing and transitions to the expandable text sections in Recent Builds:

1. **Implementation Details**:
   - Added Framer Motion (motion/react) for smooth height animations
   - Intro section: Animates from 1.5rem height to auto with gradient overlay
   - Outro section: Animates from 0px to auto with opacity fade
   - Custom easing function [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1] for natural movement
   - 0.5s duration for smooth but responsive feel

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Intro has a gradient overlay when collapsed for visual continuity
   - Outro smoothly fades in/out with height animation
   - Both sections now feel more polished and less abrupt

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/sections/home/recent-builds-section.tsx (added motion animations)

## Lessons

- The assistant treats the CONTRIBUTING.md rules as persistent top-of-mind guidance and ensures responses comply, even if the file is not reread verbatim each time.
- step1-setup.md provides comprehensive instructions for the initial setup phases
- Zebra Design brand colors: White/#FCF8F4 backgrounds, #2A2A2D/#494868/#121212 text hierarchy, #CDCBFF/#E7BDD7/#FDA7A0 accents
- Template source should be https://github.com/haramishra/lume-studio-next
- Meta title: "Zebra Design — Designers That Code with AI"
- Meta description: "I help you launch a digital product—designed and coded—faster than you thought possible. Idea → tested product in weeks, not months. Design-as-a-Service for startup founders, SMEs, and product teams."

   - zoom: 0.7
   - opacity: 90% (opacity-90 class for prominent effect)

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Used Next.js Script component for proper script loading
   - Scripts load with appropriate strategies (beforeInteractive for Three.js, afterInteractive for Vanta)
   - React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) manage the effect lifecycle
   - TypeScript any type used for window.VANTA (external library)
   - Effect is contained within the same rounded border container as the previous video

4. **Files Modified**:
   - src/components/sections/home/hero-section.tsx (replaced video with Vanta fog effect)

**Result**: The hero section now features an animated, interactive fog effect that aligns with the brand colors and creates a modern, engaging visual experience while maintaining the same layout and structure as before.
