## Background & Motivation
Building the Zebra Design one-page portfolio site using the Lume Studio Next.js template. Zebra Design helps founders and teams launch digital products—designed and coded—faster than thought possible. The site will showcase the Design-as-a-Service model with a single-page layout and separate Pricing page. The goal is to efficiently create a high-quality front-end by reusing template components and minimizing bugs.

## Key Challenges
1. **Template Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary sections (Team, Testimonials, Portfolio, Contact) while preserving reusable components
2. **Branding Updates**: Replace all Lume Studio references with Zebra Design branding
3. **Theme Customization**: Implement monochromatic theme with light background and dark text
4. **Navigation**: Convert multi-page navigation to smooth-scrolling one-page layout
5. **Component Reuse**: Maximize use of existing template components to avoid reinventing the wheel
